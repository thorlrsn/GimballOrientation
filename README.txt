** Static Standard Deviation test **

Started with one measurement at 12.4 cm.

Then at 20,30,40,50..100 cm. After that: 130, 160, 190 cm. 

** Dynamic Standard Deviation test **

1st measurement:
    Original distance to ceiling  = 2.296 m 
    Distance to checker board     = 0.542 m
    

2nd measurement:
    Distance to ceiling           = 2.337 m 
    Distance to checker board     = 0.542 m
    
3rd measurement:
    Original distance to ceiling  = 2.423 m 
    Distance to checker board     = 0.542 m
    
    
4th measurement:
    Original distance to ceiling  = 2.483 m 
    Distance to checker board     = 0.542 m
    
    
5th measurement:
    Original distance to ceiling  = 2.553 m 
    Distance to checker board     = 0.542 m
    
    
6th measurement:
    Original distance to ceiling  = 2.684 m 
    Distance to checker board     = 0.542 m
    
7th measurement:
    Original distance to ceiling  = 2.854 m 
    Distance to checker board     = 0.542 m
